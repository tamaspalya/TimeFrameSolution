# TimeFrame

TimeFrame is a project management tool that is designed to be used by students.
The system consists of an MSSQL database, an ASP.NET Web API, a website built using ASP.NET MVC, and a Windows Forms desktop application.

The website is what the end-users of TimeFrame use to create projects and teams. People can invite other users to their teams and allow them to collaborate on projects. To manage real-life projects with this tool, users can create work items or tasks, supply them with a name and description as well as give them a priority and a due date.

The desktop application is designed for the administration of TimeFrame. Currently it can be used to manage all the users registered in the system. Other use cases in the future are for example to facilitate the process of uploading new project templates.
